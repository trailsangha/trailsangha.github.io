# About

Thru-hikers on long distance footpaths like the Pacific Crest Trail often call their hiking partners "trail family."  We are a "trail sangha," supporting each other in a Zen practice adapted to being on trail.

There is, of course, no one way to practice Zen on trail.  Our roots pass through zendos, but we aren't trying to reproduce another tradition in the forest, or replace sitting meditation with walking meditation.  We don't bring gongs or stuffed cushions; we don't even bow that much.

Our roots also pass down long-distance footpaths, but we aren't trying to replicate the experience of thru-hiking.  Almost the opposite: we are based in New York City, and we inevitably hike nearby sections of trail over and over, waving to Appalachian Trail thru-hikers as they pass us by.  It can be a wonderful experience getting to know the same section of trail in all seasons and conditions.  

The forest is our zendo, the natural world our altar, and the trail our seat cushions.  We bow to the sunrise, share tea, and chant in the rain. Perhaps we intend to walk in the forest without seeing it as a reprieve from ordinary life... just something we like to do together, with a few minor rituals to tie us to each other and the world, and to those who came before us.  I don't know about you, but I like to think the "Great Way" passes somewhere through the forest ;)

This is a new sangha, born partly out of my own hiking and nature-oriented practice this past decade, which I hope can grow into a thriving group practice. Please forgive me/us if we experience growing pains, and also please help us shape it with your participation, feedback, and your own sense of how to wander outdoors. Iâ€™ve never met two people who thought hiking is the same thing---I hope we can find a middle path and walk it together.
