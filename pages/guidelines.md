# Practice Guidelines

Participation is open to all who can practice within our sangha guidelines.  Our guidelines are here to help give you a sense of what to expect and to help us maintain our safety and ability to function as a group.

We do our best to support each other on trail, but __we are not guides__; we merely practice together outdoors.  You are responsible for being properly prepared for trips, and knowing and accepting the risks inherent to our activities.  We expect your consideration in not putting yourself or others in danger or otherwise reducing the ability of the group to function.  We do our best to communicate and create an atmosphere of open communication.

Participants must have the "skills, gear, and supplies necessary for the trip objective and conditions" (as Andrew Skurka concisely puts it).  There are innumerable resources to help learn about hiking and backpacking, books, webpages, sangha members and otherwise---please use them.  Our trip descriptions and these guidelines are to help you know what to expect, but we are limited and fallible, and there no substitute for experience.

Walking in the mountains is much different than walking in the city, in part because it is more difficult and because you can't just leave.  Our walks and hikes in NYC are a good chance to learn to safely manage a variety of weather conditions and get to know our group.  Day hikes are good practice for backpacking.  Introductory backpacking trips are good practice for longer trips.  Please take care to slowly expand your comfort zone.

Please err on the side of asking too many questions.  We are happy to talk at length about what gear might work for you with the kinds of trips we go on, but it takes experience to know how your body reacts to different conditions.  Very often, simple cheap moderately light gear does quite well.  

Our outings are typically walks and hikes in and around NYC that are accessible by public transit and rarely more than 1-2 hours from a NYC transit hub.  We typically average 2mph in hilly terrain with a pack and rarely walk more than about 6hrs or travel further than about 10-12 miles per full day.  Sometimes we do sitting meditation in cold weather---this requires a lot of insulation and possibly to get up and walking around.  Exactly what we do on a given outing (be it sitting, walking, chanting, etc.) depends on the situation, including how we feel, logistics, weather, sunlight, and so forth---strict plans do not lend well to being outdoors.  Please be flexible.  This may mean hiking slower or faster than you like, and being able to hiking further than expected if conditions require it.

We typically walk in silence, but please communicate and treat others in a way that they feel encouraged to communicate!  Speak up if something happens or you need something, and do what you need to remain safe.  If you feel unsafe in a meeting location, leave and find safety.  If you get cold during sitting practice, get up and walk around.  Speak up if your leg hurts, or you need to stop for water or sunscreen.  If your feet or fingers aren't warming up, say something.  It is normal to have a trip fail sometimes; better to get home safely and try again.

Learn about ticks (especially deer ticks and Lyme disease), poison ivy, and bear etiquette, but know that sleeping with your food is widely practiced, regardless of whether or not it is a good idea. (Is is more or less dangerous than driving to the trailhead?)  Learn how to prevent blisters, and manage them if they happen.  Give up on waterproof shoes and hiking boots and wear airy trail runners most of the year.  Most seasoned backpackers use simple, cheap, relatively light gear, but there is huge variety.

We discourage sitting cross-legged, especially if it hurts, as this can be hard on or damage the ligaments in your knee.  We try not to rush or otherwise pushing too hard, as it's typically unnecessary, leads to soreness and increases the likelihood of injury (not to mention drudgery and exhaustion).  It's important to listen to your feet and body.  Eat and drink when you need.  Change clothes to  regulate your body temperature.  That said, hiking trips are rarely fun and comfortable the entire time, and there are times when we have to make miles or push ourselves harder than we like.

We typically ask new sangha members to join us on walks in NYC, before joining our hiking or backpacking trips.  This gives us a chance to get to know each other and make sure we're on the same page before we wander into the forest together.  We make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for those with relevant and recent experience, please get in touch with us!

If you have any questions, please ask!  We are happy to try and answer them, and it helps us know what kind of questions other people may have, too.

Happy trails!
