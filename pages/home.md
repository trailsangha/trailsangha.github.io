# Hi, welcome! {#about}

My name is Cameron Crowe, I live in New York City, and I'm looking for others who share my dual interest in hiking and Zen.

![Cam with Rakusu]({{ '/assets/img/cam-rakusu-small.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .rounded .m-auto height="300"}

I see the trail as a perfect place for Zen practice, and thru-hiking as a Western equivalent of going on a wandering retreat.

I took the precepts with Barry Magid, and I prefer a psychologically minded Zen practice along the lines of Joko Beck and the Ordinary Mind Zen School.

"Trail sangha" does not refer to a particular sangha, but to any sangha that forms on trail.  Analogous to what thru-hikers call "trail family".

I'm considering a PCT thru-hike for 2024 or 2025, and I regularly go backpacking in the NYC area.

I also practice locally in NYC, and you are most welcome to join!

# NYC Practice Schedule {#practice}

Most [__weekday mornings__](#calendar) at __sunrise__, starting near the __116th Street guardhouse at the top of Morningside Park__ (W116th Street and Morningside Drive).  Expect to walk most of the time at a moderate pace (__2-3mph__) for __60-90min__.  

If this is your first time, please let me know you're coming: [trailsangha@gmail.com](mailto:trailsangha@gmail.com).
