# Hi, welcome!  Wanna join us for a silent hike?

We are a hiking-oriented sangha in New York City.

We practice year-round, in all kinds of weather.

All are welcome, including those new to hiking, backpacking, or Zen practice.  Please read more about [about us]({{ '/about.html' | relative_url }}) and our [practice guidelines]({{ '/guidelines.html' | relative_url }}).
