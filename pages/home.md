This is a greatly simplified version of this page. Look in drafts folder.  Map, calendar, "hotbutton"s available from when I was trying to do daily walking practice in NYC.

# Hi, welcome! {#about}

My name is Cameron Crowe, I live in New York City, and I'm looking for others who share my dual interest in hiking and Zen.

Zen and hiking are many things to many people, but I think what we seek in them is largely the same: escape, structure, safety, meaning, connection, etc.---all just very ordinary, human things. It's not my belief that ordinary humans need extraordinary practices. Rather, I think those of us drawn to practice on trail or on a cushion would be wise to spend our time simply addressing what brings us here.

My favorite Zen teachers are Barry Magid (with whom I took the precepts) and Karen Terzano (a fellow hiker), and I feel like Zen practice is largely about showing up and being honest. Whatever practice is, I hope we can find a way to do it together... on a trail through the forest :) 

I spent the last several years practicing in Ordinary Mind Zendo in NYC and local, and I took the precepts with Barry Magid in 2022. And I'm considering a PCT thru-hike for 2024 or 2025.

If something of this resonates with you or you want to find a way to practice together---and especially if you can think of a good trail name for a hiking sangha ;)---I would love to [hear from you](#contact)!

Happy trails!
